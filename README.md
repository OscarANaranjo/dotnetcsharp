C# (.NET Framework) scripts for integrating Momentus CRM with Mailchimp, SendGrid, and HubSpot. Automates email marketing KPI ingestion (opens, clicks, bounces, unsubscribes) and supports Excel-based exports to Salesforce and Power BI for centralized visibility.

This repository contains C# (.NET Framework) code developed for integrating Momentus CRM with email marketing platforms including Mailchimp, SendGrid, and HubSpot. The scripts automate the ingestion of key campaign KPIs—such as email opens, clicks, bounces, and unsubscribes—into CRM campaigns, enabling teams to easily identify hot leads and track engagement directly from the CRM.
Excel is used as a flexible staging layer to simplify coding, support non-technical users, and enable seamless exports to Salesforce and Power BI for centralized visibility and executive reporting.
